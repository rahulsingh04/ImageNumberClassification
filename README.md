# Image Number Classification 

"In this project, we have numerical images ranging from numbers 1 to 100. 
Our objective is to build a convolutional neural network or utilize transfer learning techniques to distinguish between these numbers depicted in the images."

In this project, we explored both transfer learning techniques and custom convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify numerical images ranging from 1 to 100. Despite our efforts, the performance of the models remained unsatisfactory.

To enhance model performance, we employed TensorFlow's image augmentation techniques to generate diverse datasets. Additionally, within the CNN architecture, we integrated batch normalization and dropout layers to mitigate overfitting. However, despite experimenting with complex CNN architectures, the results remained suboptimal.

Progress is still ongoing for this project.
